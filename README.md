Xcode 9 navigation issue after navigating from left side menu

In support of this stackowerflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46491327/xcode-9-navigation-bar-issue-after-navigating-from-left-side-menu-on-ios-11-not

"After updating from Xcode 8 to Xcode 9 I've noticed this very strange behaviour in the navigation bar only on devices running iOS 11.

This bug appears after navigating from my left side menu that show the menu controller you choose modally with a default presentation (That is Full Screen)

I've post a video here: https://youtu.be/mgjlbkMi-N8

It seems a bug of the compilation on Xcode 9.

I've put a playground code here: https://github.com/shadowsheep1/xcode9navigationissue

With alrady a workaround: set the presentation to Over Full Screen.

But that has no meaning and why and, above all, I don't wanna do that.

Once the navigation bar is broken, is broken for every navigation controller in the App. O_O

Any idea?"
